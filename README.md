# FlowController
Python program with GUI for controlling up to 4 Mass Flow Controller heads via a Brooks 0254 (and probably the single head version, Brooks 0251)

Created as part of Sensor Technology course at AGH UST, summer 2020/2021. Later continued as part of my engineering thesis at AGH UST.

## Features
- Up to 4 indepentend tabs controlling individual MFCs connected to device,
- Implementation of most important functions, like Valve Override and Process Configuration,
- Customizable sampling interval and sample buffer size,
- Support for gathering data from up to 2 serial devices per controller,
- Saving gathered data to CSV files,
- (Untested) Control of AR6X2 heating devices, with gradient and readout support
- PyQt graph showing the readouts from device, enabling many functions of this library to be used, 
- Dosing function, which allows the user to specify setpoints at specific points in time
- (Untested) Simultaneous starting of dosing processes and saving to CSVs for accurate measurements.
- Clean, responsive user interface
